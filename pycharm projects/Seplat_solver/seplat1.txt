A snail creeps 9 ft up a wall during the daytime. After all the labor it does throughout the day, it stops to rest a while... but falls asleep!! The next morning it wakes up and discovers that it has slipped down 5 ft while sleeping. If this happens every day, how many days will the snail take to reach the top of a wall 17ft in height?

=
A.
5 days  


B.
4 days  


C.
3 days 


D.
2 days 


E.
1 day 

The correct answer is option [C] Solution: On the first day, the snail climbs up 9 ft and slips down 5 ft while sleeping. So, next morning, it is 4 ft from where it started. The snail thus travels 4 ft upwards every day. Therefore, in 2 days, it has traveled a distance of 8 ft from the bottom. Here lies the catch to the problem! On the last day, the snail travels 9 ft upwards and hence reaches the top of the wall in a total of 3 days.

You're driving your car on the highway at 75 mph, and you notice a sign that says you are 75 miles from your destination. So if you continue driving at that speed, you'd be there in an hour. When you have driven one mile and you are now 74 miles from your destination, you drop your speed down to 74 mph. So, you drive that first mile at 75 mph; when you are 74 miles from your destination, you drop your speed down to 74 mph; and then 73 mph, 72 mph... and so on.
